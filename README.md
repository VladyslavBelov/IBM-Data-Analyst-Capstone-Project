# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

Welcome to the **IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project**, which marks the final milestone in obtaining the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. This project places me in the role of a **Data Analyst** for a global IT and business consulting company, renowned for its expertise in IT solutions.

The purpose of this project is to apply the data analysis knowledge and skills gained during the course to address a real-world business challenge. As part of the project, I will focus on collecting, analyzing, and reporting data on **emerging skill requirements** in the IT industry, helping the company maintain a competitive edge in this fast-evolving sector.

## Project Overview:

The project follows a structured data analysis process, closely aligned with real-world data analyst workflows. Here’s a breakdown of the key phases of this project:

### Module 1: Data Collection
The first step involves gathering data on in-demand programming and technical skills from various sources, including:
- Job listings
- Learning platforms
- Industry surveys

I will use techniques like web scraping, APIs, and database queries to collect this information in formats such as CSV, Excel, and SQL.

### Module 2: Data Wrangling
Once the data is collected, I will clean and prepare it for analysis using **data wrangling techniques**. This includes managing missing data, standardizing values, and structuring the dataset for subsequent analysis.

### Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this phase, I will conduct **exploratory data analysis** (EDA) to discover patterns and trends in the data. Using tools like **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Scipy**, and **Matplotlib**, I’ll identify correlations, distributions, outliers, and other key insights.

### Module 4: Data Visualization
To make the findings more accessible and actionable, I’ll create data visualizations. Utilizing libraries such as **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **IBM Cognos Analytics**, I will design charts and graphs that illustrate:
- The top programming languages in demand
- Popular database technologies
- Frequently used Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

### Module 5: Dashboard Development
Next, I’ll develop an interactive **dashboard** using **IBM Cognos Analytics**. This dashboard will provide a visual overview of the key insights, enabling stakeholders to explore emerging trends and make informed decisions regarding skill development and training priorities.

### Module 6: Final Presentation
The project will conclude with a **presentation** of the findings. Through data storytelling, I will present a comprehensive overview that includes:
- A concise executive summary
- Core findings from the analysis
- Visualized trends and key conclusions

The final deliverable will evaluate my ability to convey data-driven insights effectively.

## Tools and Technologies:

- **Python**: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **SQL**: For database querying and analysis
- **IBM Cognos Analytics**: For dashboard creation and visual reporting
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For scripting, analysis, and documentation

## Conclusion:
This capstone project demonstrates my ability to manage the entire **data analysis lifecycle**, from **data collection and wrangling** to **visualization and presentation**. The tasks simulated in this project reflect those of a professional Data Analyst, equipping me with the skills needed to tackle industry challenges.
